# Russian Mentality
**Russian Mentality** is an endless runner racing video game loosely related to stereotyped road traffic in Russia. The gameplay is pretty uncomplicated: the player is driving a Mercedes-Benz G-Class and his task to literally jump across the traffic with Space bar. If the player collides with another car, the game ends with a time score which is saved to the score table.
